Mappings~

The mappings Vim-marc uses can be created with the 'map' command.
To add mappings for the above commands to your vimrc file use:

    map <C-K> :MrcCompile<CR>
    map <C-L> :MrcDisplay<CR>

These can be changed to a hot key of your choice.

Note: A list of predefined mode-specific mappings can be inserted in
/plugin/vim-marc.vim
