" VIM has a maximum # of characters per line that it can highlight be default.
" This value is 3000. If you have a long record, or multiple records in a
" single .mrc file you may hit the highlighting limit. To remove the limit add
" set smc=0 to your vimrc file. Warning: this may add redraw delay.
" Alternatively set it to a large value of your choice (e.g. 10000). For more
" details on smc type :help smc.
